    "The Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. The idea behind Transformer is to handle the dependencies between input and output with attention and recurrence completely.<br>\n",

    "Let‚Äôs first focus on the Encoder and Decoder parts only.Now focus on the below image. The Encoder block has 1 layer of a Multi-Head Attention followed by another layer of Feed Forward Neural Network. The decoder, on the other hand, has an extra Masked Multi-Head Attention.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoder**: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection around each ofthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)),where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layeritself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embeddinglayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoder**: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
    "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
    "predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder and decoder blocks are actually multiple identical encoders and decoders stacked on top of each other. Both the encoder stack and the decoder stack have the same number of units.The number of encoder and decoder units is a hyperparameter <br>\n",

    "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention, is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence.<br>\n",

    "# 3. Understanding BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): <br>\n",
    "BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is a **deeply bidirectional** model. Bidirectional means that BERT learns information from both the left and the right side of a token‚Äôs context during the training phase.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The bidirectionality of a model is important for truly understanding the meaning of a language. Let‚Äôs see an example to illustrate this. There are two sentences in this example and both of them involve the word ‚Äúbank‚Äù:<br>\n",

That‚Äôs exactly what BERT does. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 How Does BERT Work? <br>\n",
    "### 3.1.1 BERT‚Äôs Architecture: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The BERT architecture builds on top of Transformer. We currently have two variants available:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* BERT Base: 12 layers (transformer blocks), 12 attention heads, and 110 million parameters\n",
    "* BERT Large: 24 layers (transformer blocks), 16 attention heads and, 340 million parameters\n",

    "## 3.2 Text processing for BERT:<br>\n",
    "![](https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bert_emnedding.png)<br>\n",
    "For bert,every input embedding is a combination of 3 embeddings:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Position Embeddings**: BERT learns and uses positional embeddings to express the position of words in a sentence. These are added to overcome the limitation of Transformer which, unlike an RNN, is not able to capture ‚Äúsequence‚Äù or ‚Äúorder‚Äù information<br>\n",
    "**Segment Embeddings**: BERT can also take sentence pairs as inputs for tasks (Question-Answering). That‚Äôs why it learns a unique embedding for the first and the second sentences to help the model distinguish between them. In the above example, all the tokens marked as EA belong to sentence A (and similarly for EB)<br>\n",
    "**Token Embeddings**: These are the embeddings learned for the specific token from the WordPiece token vocabulary<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given token, its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token, segment, and position embeddings.Such a comprehensive embedding scheme contains a lot of useful information for the model.These combinations of preprocessing steps make BERT so versatile.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When training language models, there is a challenge of defining a prediction goal. Many models predict the next word in a sequence, a directional approach which inherently limits context learning. To overcome this challenge, BERT uses two training strategies:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Masked LM (MLM): <br>\n",
    "Before feeding word sequences into BERT, 15% of the words in each sequence are replaced with a [MASK] token. The model then attempts to predict the original value of the masked words, based on the context provided by the other, non-masked, words in the sequence. In technical terms, the prediction of the output words requires:\n",
    "1. Adding a classification layer on top of the encoder output.<br>\n",
    "2. Multiplying the output vectors by the embedding matrix, transforming them into the vocabulary dimension.<br>\n",
    "3. Calculating the probability of each word in the vocabulary with softmax.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/986/0*ViwaI3Vvbnd-CJSQ.png)<br>\n",
    "The BERT loss function takes into consideration only the prediction of the masked values and ignores the prediction of the non-masked words. As a consequence, the model converges slower than directional models, a characteristic which is offset by its increased context awareness.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): <br>\n",
    "In the BERT training process, the model receives pairs of sentences as input and learns to predict if the second sentence in the pair is the subsequent sentence in the original document. During training, 50% of the inputs are a pair in which the second sentence is the subsequent sentence in the original document, while in the other 50% a random sentence from the corpus is chosen as the second sentence. The assumption is that the random sentence will be disconnected from the first sentence.<br>\n",
    "To help the model distinguish between the two sentences in training, the input is processed in the following way before entering the model:<br>\n",
    "1. A [CLS] token is inserted at the beginning of the first sentence and a [SEP] token is inserted at the end of each sentence.\n",
    "2. A sentence embedding indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token. Sentence embeddings are similar in concept to token embeddings with a vocabulary of 2.\n",
    "3. A positional embedding is added to each token to indicate its position in the sequence. The concept and implementation of positional embedding are presented in the Transformer paper.\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1321/0*m_kXt3uqZH9e7H4w.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict if the second sentence is indeed connected to the first, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "1. The entire input sequence goes through the Transformer model.\n",
    "2. The output of the [CLS] token is transformed into a 2√ó1 shaped vector, using a simple classification layer (learned matrices of weights and biases).\n",
    "3. Calculating the probability of IsNextSequence with softmax.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When training the BERT model, Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction are trained together, with the goal of minimizing the combined loss function of the two strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 How to use BERT (Fine-tuning):\n",
    "Using BERT for a specific task is relatively straightforward:<br>\n",
    "BERT can be used for a wide variety of language tasks, while only adding a small layer to the core model:<br>\n",
    "1. Classification tasks such as sentiment analysis are done similarly to Next Sentence classification, by adding a classification layer on top of the Transformer output for the [CLS] token.<br>\n",
    "2. In Question Answering tasks (e.g. SQuAD v1.1), the software receives a question regarding a text sequence and is required to mark the answer in the sequence. Using BERT, a Q&A model can be trained by learning two extra vectors that mark the beginning and the end of the answer.<br>\n",
    "3. In Named Entity Recognition (NER), the software receives a text sequence and is required to mark the various types of entities (Person, Organization, Date, etc) that appear in the text. Using BERT, a NER model can be trained by feeding the output vector of each token into a classification layer that predicts the NER label.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Takeaways:\n",
    "1. Model size matters, even at huge scale. BERT_large, with 345 million parameters, is the largest model of its kind. It is demonstrably superior on small-scale tasks to BERT_base, which uses the same architecture with ‚Äúonly‚Äù 110 million parameters.<br>\n",
    "2. With enough training data, more training steps == higher accuracy. For instance, on the MNLI task, the BERT_base accuracy improves by 1.0% when trained on 1M steps (128,000 words batch size) compared to 500K steps with the same batch size.<br>\n",
    "3. BERT‚Äôs bidirectional approach (MLM) converges slower than left-to-right approaches (because only 15% of words are predicted in each batch) but bidirectional training still outperforms left-to-right training after a small number of pre-training steps.<br>\n",
